# Line-finding Code Documentation 

This software is used to identify line-emitting objects and measure emission line properties in JWST NIRISS WFSS grism spectra, specifically from the pure-parallel survey PASSAGE (PID#1571). Installation instructions, including required packages, instructions for running the code, and user input options can be found below.  


**INSTALLATION:**  

0. Before installing, it is recommended that you create an environment with the following versions:

    python>=3.9<br>
    numpy>=1.26.4<br>
    astropy>=5.3, <7<br>
    pandas>=1.0, <3<br>
    scipy==1.14.1 (this one is strict)<br>
    matplotlib>=3.6, <3.11<br>

    For example: conda create --name myenv python=3.11 numpy=1.26.4 astropy=5.7 pandas=1.0 scipy=1.14.1 matplotlib=3.11

1. The simplest way to install the software is to clone this repo. <br>
    ```git clone https://github.com/jwstwfss/line-finding```

    If you already have the code installed, but would like to pull the latest changes, please use the following 2 commands:
    ```git pull``` followed by ```pip install -e  .```



**RUNNING THE SOFTWARE:**  

After installation, to run the software, simply go into the cloned directory and run 

*python mainPASSAGE.py*

The user will be asked to enter the number of a parallel field and a username of choice (typically the user's name). The fitting is then performed on an object-by-object basis. 

The following is a list of commands for this software.


**Some Recommendations**
We suggest you set some defaults in your own installation of DS9. If you go to Settings --> Preferences --> Menus and Buttons and then find the WCS menu and select Degrees, it will default to degrees every time you open DS9. You can also set other defaults in this way (e.g., zscale instead of min/max).


**OBJECT SPECIFIC OPTIONS:**  

a = accept object fit  

ac = accept object fit, noting contamination  

r = reject object  

c = add comment  

user = toggle between previously saved fits  

contam = specify contamination to line flux and/or continuum  

reset = reset interactive options back to default for this object  

s = print the (in progress) object summary


**EMISSION LINE SPECIFIC OPTIONS:**  

z = enter a different z guess  

w = enter a different emission line wavelength guess

dz = change the allowable redshift difference between lines  

n = skip to next brightest line found in this object

2gauss = double gaussian profile for the line being fitted

1gauss = option to go back to 1 gaussian fit after selecting 2 gaussian fit

ha, hb, hg, o31, o32, o2, s2, s31, s32, lya, c4, pa, pb, pg = change strongest emission line
