# Documentation for line-finding code

This software is used to identify line-emitting objects and measure emission line properties in JWST NIRISS WFSS Grism spectra, based on the pure-parallel survey PASSAGE (PID#1571). Installation instructions, including required packages, are in **passage_analysis/README.md** 

After installation, to run the software, simply go into the git cloned directory and run 

*python mainPASSAGE.py*

The user will be asked to enter the number of a parallel field and a username of choice. The fitting is then performed on an object-by-object basis. 

The following is a list of commands for this software.

**OBJECT SPECIFIC OPTIONS:**  

a = accept object fit  

ac = accept object fit, noting contamination  

r = reject object  

c = add comment  

user = toggle between previously saved fits  

contam = specify contamination to line flux and/or continuum  

reset = reset interactive options back to default for this object  

s = print the (in progress) object summary


**EMISSION LINE SPECIFIC OPTIONS:**  

z = enter a different z guess  

w = enter a different emission line wavelength guess

dz = change the allowable redshift difference between lines  

n = skip to next brightest line found in this object

2gauss = double gaussian profile for the line being fitted

1gauss = option to go back to 1 gaussian fit after selecting 2 gaussian fit

ha, hb, hg, o31, o32, o2, s2, s31, s32, lya, c4, pb, pa, pg = change strongest emission line

The full list of commands and corresponding lines are as follows
